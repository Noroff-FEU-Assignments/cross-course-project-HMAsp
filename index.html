    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      We want to secure our data just like you would want to secure your house
      from intruders. I would recommend our client to take advantage of web
      security best practices such as sanitization of data. This practice
      ensures that the data a system accepts is in the right format. We should
      use open-standard protocols or frameworks to ensure that authorization and
      authentication are hard to crack. Packets will be protected by the network
      security both wireless and wired. Also an implementation of automatic user
      timeout is recommended as it involves protecting users who have left their
      credentials hangin in the browser over a long time. In most cases this
      would be done by the backend team, but we will ensure that the API has
      this consideration.These are the acts of protecting your information on
      the world wide web from threats.
